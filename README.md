# Corona-Fighters
Considering the big change that the world is facing, COVID-19 Pandemic spreads around the world.
Current evidence suggests that the way of its spreading is mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another person.
It can be transmitted from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe heavily.
It has a negative impact on food security, public health, economy and employment. It causes labour issues and many other difficult troubles.
Having said that, We started thinking about how can we use what we are currently learning in the image processing course to positively aid in finding out a method to reduce the risk of contracting the virus and the risk of passing it on to others.
This could be done by staying at least 1 meter away from others, even if they aren’t apparently sick or have any obvious symptoms.
The system is based on Computer Vision methods that allow computers to process objects in videos and images like humans do. 
Given a frame captured from a scene, we must apply a filtering technique to identify people and detect them, 
by determining their position. Therefore, the program calculates pairwise distance between them to compare it with the allowed distance. 
To decide whether the distance between them is appropriate or not, the algorithm checks the distance matrix for people less than N pixels apart.
Finally, by testing the frame, if the system predicts that people will violate social distancing, a warning will be occurred by the algorithm,to avoid face to face contact with people. 
The reason lies in the fact that many humans are careless about this pandemic by not keeping a safe distance.
